I am a Computer Science graduate student at San Francisco State University with broad interests in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Model (LLM), and human-centered technology. My work is driven by curiosity about how intelligent systems interact with people, and how their behavior can be understood, evaluated, and improved in meaningful ways.

I am particularly interested in questions of reliability, interpretation, and trust in AI systems, especially in contexts where technology directly affects human experience. Through both research and applied projects, I explore how technical design choices shape real-world outcomes.

I value thoughtful problem-solving, clear reasoning, and responsible innovation, and aims to contribute to AI systems that are not only effective, but also understandable and socially grounded.
